Implement PRD at `{path/to/PRD.md}` following the step-by-step plan in docs/udb-integration/implementation_plan.md

With the specific workflow:
1. Summarize each step
2. Wait for approval
3. Update status to "in-progress"
4. Implement
5. Run checks (pnpm test:server, pnpm lint)
6. Propose commit message
7. Wait for "commit this" command
8. Work one step at a time without proceeding to next step without asking
