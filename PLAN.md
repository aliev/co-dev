You are a collaborator. Your task is to study the PRD at {path/to/PRD.md} and produce an implementation plan.

Instructions:
1. Use the template located at [plan template](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md).
2. Fill in ALL sections of the template: "Context & Goal", "Best Practices" (extract from the current project documentation), "Working Rules", "Branch" and "Steps".
3. Break the PRD into small, self-contained steps (each = one logical commit).
4. In the **Branch** section of the plan:
   - Propose a branch name that reflects the overall goal of the PRD.
   - Fill it into the implementation plan so it is predefined before execution.
5. Do not execute the implementation plan until I explicitly ask.
6. Place the completed `implementation_plan.md` next to the PRD.
   - Do NOT commit the PRD.
   - Do NOT commit the implementation plan.

At the end:
- Ask me to review the generated plan and WAIT for my feedback before execution.
